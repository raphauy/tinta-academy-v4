## 2026-01-06 - Database Schema & API Foundation

**Completed (PRD items 2.01-2.09):**
- Added Course, Tag, and NewsletterSubscription models to Prisma schema
- Created CourseType, CourseModality, and CourseStatus enums  
- Implemented many-to-many relationship between Course and Tag
- Added wsetLevel field for WSET courses
- Enhanced seed script with 3 educators, 6 tags, and 6 sample courses
- Created API routes: /api/courses (with filtering), /api/tags, /api/newsletter

**Technical Notes:**
- Used Prisma migrations instead of db push for better version control
- API routes support query parameters for filtering courses by modality, type, tagIds
- Courses are automatically separated into upcoming vs past based on startDate and status
- Newsletter API uses Zod validation and handles duplicate emails gracefully

**Next Priority:** UI components (CourseCard, CourseCatalog, Hero, Footer)
